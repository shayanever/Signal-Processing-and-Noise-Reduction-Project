# Signal-Processing-and-Noise-Reduction-Project
A MATLAB-based project exploring various noise reduction techniques for audio signal processing. It includes scripts for applying and comparing filters like FIR, IIR, LMS, and Wiener to improve Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) across different noise types, with visualizations and detailed analysis.
